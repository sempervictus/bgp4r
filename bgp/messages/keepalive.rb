# KEEPALIVE Message Format
#
#    BGP does not use any TCP-based, keep-alive mechanism to determine if
#    peers are reachable.  Instead, KEEPALIVE messages are exchanged
#    between peers often enough not to cause the Hold Timer to expire.  A
#    reasonable maximum time between KEEPALIVE messages would be one third
#    of the Hold Time interval.  KEEPALIVE messages MUST NOT be sent more
#    frequently than one per second.  An implementation MAY adjust the
#    rate at which it sends KEEPALIVE messages as a function of the Hold
#    Time interval.
#
#    If the negotiated Hold Time interval is zero, then periodic KEEPALIVE
#    messages MUST NOT be sent.
#
#    A KEEPALIVE message consists of only the message header and has a
#    length of 19 octets.
