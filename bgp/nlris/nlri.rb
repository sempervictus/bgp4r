Nlri is a collection of Nlri_elements or a collection of Path_nlri_elements


Path_nlri_element

- path_id
- Nlri_element



3. Extended NLRI Encodings

In order to carry the Path Identifier in an UPDATE message, the
existing NLRI encodings are extended by prepending the Path
Identifier field, which is of four-octets.

For example, the NLRI encodings specified in [RFC4271, RFC4760] are
extended as the following:


+--------------------------------+
| Path Identifier (4 octets)     |
+--------------------------------+
| Length (1 octet)               |
+--------------------------------+
| Prefix (variable)              |
+--------------------------------+


and the NLRI encoding specified in [RFC3107] is extended as the
following:

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-ietf-idr-add-paths-04.txt          August 2010


+--------------------------------+
| Path Identifier (4 octets)     |
+--------------------------------+
| Length (1 octet)               |
+--------------------------------+
| Label (3 octets)               |
+--------------------------------+
| ...                            |
+--------------------------------+
| Prefix (variable)              |
+--------------------------------+


The usage of the extended NLRI encodings is specified in the
Operation section.

RFC 3107          Carrying Label Information in BGP-4           May 2001


3. Carrying Label Mapping Information

Label mapping information is carried as part of the Network Layer
Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol Extensions
attributes.  The AFI indicates, as usual, the address family of the
associated route.  The fact that the NLRI contains a label is
indicated by using SAFI value 4.

The Network Layer Reachability information is encoded as one or more
triples of the form <length, label, prefix>, whose fields are
described below:

+---------------------------+
|   Length (1 octet)        |
+---------------------------+
|   Label (3 octets)        |
+---------------------------+
.............................
+---------------------------+
|   Prefix (variable)       |
+---------------------------+

The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

a) Length:

The Length field indicates the length in bits of the address
prefix plus the label(s).

b) Label:

The Label field carries one or more labels (that corresponds to
the stack of labels [MPLS-ENCAPS]).  Each label is encoded as 3
octets, where the high-order 20 bits contain the label value,
and the low order bit contains "Bottom of Stack" (as defined in
[MPLS-ENCAPS]).

c) Prefix:

The Prefix field contains address prefixes followed by enough
trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on an octet
boundary.  Note that the value of trailing bits is irrelevant.



Rekhter & Rosen             Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 3107          Carrying Label Information in BGP-4           May 2001


The label(s) specified for a particular route (and associated with
its address prefix) must be assigned by the LSR which is identified
by the value of the Next Hop attribute of the route.

When a BGP speaker redistributes a route, the label(s) assigned to
that route must not be changed (except by omission), unless the
speaker changes the value of the Next Hop attribute of the route.

A BGP speaker can withdraw a previously advertised route (as well as
the binding between this route and a label) by either (a) advertising
a new route (and a label) with the same NLRI as the previously
advertised route, or (b) listing the NLRI of the previously
advertised route in the Withdrawn Routes field of an Update message.
The label information carried (as part of NLRI) in the Withdrawn
Routes field should be set to 0x800000.  (Of course, terminating the
BGP session also withdraws all the previously advertised routes.)
